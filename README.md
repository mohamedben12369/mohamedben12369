 Hi, I'm MOHAMED BENHAMMOU
 Front-End developpementðŸ’» |Backend-PHP/SQL | C++ Game Enthusiast 

   Iâ€™m highly motivated to create stunning, responsive web pages using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. I also have a strong desire to deepen my knowledge of PHP, Laravel, and SQL, aiming to build dynamic, full-stack applications. Iâ€™m fascinated by how these technologies work together to create powerful web applications, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn more.
    Iâ€™m equally driven to develop game(Maze game) in C++ with *Raylib* library. Game development allows me to explore creative coding, problem-solving, and designing interactive experiences.
